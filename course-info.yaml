summary: One of the most difficult parts of learning a new language is remembering
  all the words you need to memorize, which is exactly what flashcards are for. Typically,
  flashcards show a hint (a task or a picture) on one side and the correct answer
  on the other. Flashcards can be used to remember all kinds of information, so if
  you want to create something useful to help you enhance your programming skills,
  this project may be just right for you.<br/><br/>Learn more at <a href="https://hyperskill.org">https://hyperskill.org/projects/83</a>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">Description</h2>

<p>Improve the application's interactivity by having it ask the user for and perform an action.<br>
<br>
The program should support these actions:</p>

<ul>
	<li>add a card: <code>add</code>,</li>
	<li>remove a card: <code>remove</code>,</li>
	<li>load cards from file: <code>import</code>,</li>
	<li>save cards to file: <code>export</code>,</li>
	<li>ask for a definition of some random cards: <code>ask</code>,</li>
	<li>exit the program: <code>exit</code>.</li>
</ul>

<p>When entering the word <code>export</code>, the program should request a file name and write all currently available cards into this file.<br>
When entering the word <code>import</code>, the program should request a file name and read all the cards written to this file.</p>

<p>You can use any format to save cards to the file. Tests do not check the content of the file, but they do check that all saved cards are loaded correctly.</p>

<p>At this stage, if you try to add a card with an existing term or definition, the application will reject it and print an error message (see example 1).</p>

<p>When you load cards from a file, you shouldn't erase the cards that aren't in the file. If the imported card already exists, it should update the old one (look at the Japan and Moscow cards in example 2). There won't be any conflicts with definitions in the tests.</p>

<p>You can use <a href="https://kotlinlang.org/api/latest/jvm/stdlib/kotlin.io/java.io.-file/write-text.html" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">writeText</a> function to save the data to a file.</p>

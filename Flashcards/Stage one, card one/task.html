<h2 style="text-align: center;">Description</h2>

<p>A flashcard is a piece of paper that contains a term on one side and a related text, which may be translation or explanation, on the other. Flashcards are often used for learning a foreign language, so for this project, weâ€™ll say that the text on the back of the card is the definition of a term.</p>

<p>In this project, you will create an application that emulates a set of flashcards on a screen. While developing this application, you will not only learn some programming, but you will also save paper!</p>

<p>To begin with, implement a program that outputs a single term and its definition. At this stage, the term can be anything you want.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">How to submit?</h2>

<p>This stage is auto-graded. The grader will check that:</p>

<ul>
	<li>You output 4 lines.</li>
	<li>The first line is <code>Card:</code>.</li>
	<li>The third line is <code>Definition:</code>.</li>
</ul>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">Examples</h2>

<p>Here are some output examples to clarify what the result should look like.</p>

<pre><code class="language-no-highlight">Card:
purchase
Definition:
buy</code></pre>

<p>This is valid too:</p>

<pre><code class="language-no-highlight">Card:
cos'(x)
Definition:
-sin(x)</code></pre>

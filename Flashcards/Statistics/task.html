<h2 style="text-align: center;">Description</h2>

<p>Add some statistics features. We suggest you implement the following:</p>

<ul style="list-style-type: square;">
	<li>
	<p>The <code>log</code> action saves the application log to the given file. It should save all lines that have been input in or output to the console to the file. You can use a list to store the lines.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>The <code>hardest card</code> action prints the term of the card that has the most mistakes. You can store the mistake count in a map. If there are no cards with mistakes, you should print <code>There are no cards with errors.</code> For multiple hardest cards, you should list them all like in the example below.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>The <code>reset stats</code> action erases the mistake counts for all cards.</p>
	</li>
</ul>

<p>Also, remember to update serialization and deserialization to store sets of three items (term, definition, mistakes) instead of pairs (term, definition).</p>

<p>At this stage, you may want toÂ use a <a href="https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/collections-overview.html#list" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">MutableList</a>.</p>

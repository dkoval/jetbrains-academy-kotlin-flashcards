<p>Users often use files to save their progress and restore it next time they run the program. It's tedious to print the actions manually. Sometimes you can just forget to do it! So let's add run arguments that define which file to read at the start and which file to save at the exit.</p>

<p>To read an initial card set from an external file, you should pass the argument <code>-import</code> and follow it with the file name. If the argument is present, the first line of your program output should be <code>10 cards have been loaded.</code> Later on, replace <code>10</code> with the number of cards. If such an argument is not set, the set of cards should initially be empty.</p>

<p>If the <code>-export</code> argument is set and followed by the file name, you should write all the cards that are in the program memory into this file after the user has enteredÂ <code>exit</code>, and the last line of your program should be <code>10 cards have been saved.</code></p>

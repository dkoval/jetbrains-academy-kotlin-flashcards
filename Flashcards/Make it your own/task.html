<h2 style="text-align: center;">Description</h2>

<p>Your program can entertain users with one card, which isn’t really fun. Let's take our game to the next level and implement a set of cards.</p>

<p>Let the user decide how many cards they would like to keep. First, ask the player to enter the desired number of cards. Then, ask them to input the term and the definition for every card.</p>

<p>In the end, once all of the cards have been defined and saved, your program is finally ready to be used as a game! Question the player about all the new words they have entered. The program should give the term and ask for a definition. Let the fun begin!</p>

<p>You can use <a href="https://kotlinlang.org/api/latest/jvm/stdlib/kotlin/-array/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Array</a> to store your cards. Here is a <a href="https://www.journaldev.com/17339/kotlin-array" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">tutorial</a> on how to use it.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">How to submit?</h2>

<p>This stage is auto-graded. The grader will behave as in the example, so you can change the internal logic of your code, but the output should be similar. Here are some important notes:</p>

<ul>
	<li>When you ask for a definition of a card, you should write the term of the card in quotes. Example: <code>Print the definition of "black":</code>.</li>
	<li>If the answer is correct, you should print <code>Correct answer.</code>, and if the answer is wrong, you should print <code>Wrong answer. The correct one is "black".</code>, where <code>"black"</code> is the correct definition.</li>
</ul>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">Example</h2>

<p>The symbol <code>&gt;</code> represents the user input. Notice that it's not the part of the input.</p>

<pre><code class="language-no-highlight">Input the number of cards:
&gt; 2
The card #1:
&gt; black
The definition of the card #1:
&gt; white
The card #2:
&gt; white
The definition of the card #2:
&gt; black
Print the definition of "black":
&gt; white
Correct answer.
Print the definition of "white":
&gt; blue
Wrong answer. The correct one is "black".
</code></pre>

<p><em>Note that all your outputs and user inputs should be on separate lines.</em></p>
